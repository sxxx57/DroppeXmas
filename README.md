## Idea with Adobe Xd
The color I have decided to use is my first impression of droppe.
There shows 5 carts for children. Each cart can be edited separately. Also, parents can add more carrts if they want to order the gifts for their selves or friends. There is a button under each cart for user to remove cart.
There are checkboxs for not only items, but carts. So, it will be easier for the users who want to pay part of items from the cart.
Before check out, users can check out the discount, how much money they saved and how much they will pay.
