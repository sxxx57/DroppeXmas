## Idea with Adobe Xd
The color I have decided to use is my first impression of droppe.
There shows 5 carts for children. Each cart can be edited separately. Also, parents can add more carrts if they want to order the gifts for their selves or friends. there is a button under each cart for user to remove cart.
